I entered a command that is called by typing / setjob2 [ID] [job] [grade] to set the second job of a player. Any job can be set as a second job but if it is not configured it will not work. For the configuration, just go to the files of any of your work and change the conditions that verify the player's work from PlayerData.job to PlayerData.job2. The resource also supports second salary both from a company (requires esx_society) and normally, but to have company management as a second job you will need to create an esx_society modification.
